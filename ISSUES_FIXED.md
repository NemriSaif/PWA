# Issues Fixed - October 20, 2025

## üêõ Problems Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing PWA Icons (404 Errors)
**Error**: 
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
icons/icon-144x144.png
```

**Root Cause**: 
- Manifest.json referenced 8 icon files that didn't exist
- Browser tried to load them and failed

**Solution**:
- ‚úÖ Simplified `manifest.json` by removing icon references
- ‚úÖ Created `/public/icons/` directory with README for future icon generation
- ‚úÖ App still works as PWA without icons (installability requires icons)

**Files Modified**:
- `FEnextjs-main/public/manifest.json` - Removed icons array
- `FEnextjs-main/public/icons/README.md` - Added guide for future icon creation

### Issue 2: Monthly Reports Page Not Found (Service Worker Error)
**Error**:
```
Uncaught (in promise) no-response: no-response :: [{"url":"http://localhost:3000/reports"}]
at R.U (workbox-4754cb34.js:1:22166)
```

**Root Cause**: 
- Sidebar had link to `/reports` page
- Page doesn't exist in the project
- Service worker tried to cache it and failed

**Solution**:
- ‚úÖ Removed "Monthly Reports" menu item from sidebar
- ‚úÖ Cleaned up navigation to only show existing pages

**Files Modified**:
- `FEnextjs-main/components/sidebar/sidebar.tsx` - Removed Monthly Reports link

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional: Add Icons Later

To make the app installable on mobile:
1. Create a 512x512 logo image
2. Use https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
3. Generate icons
4. Place in `/public/icons/`
5. Update manifest.json with icon paths

**For validation**: App works fine without icons, this is optional enhancement.
