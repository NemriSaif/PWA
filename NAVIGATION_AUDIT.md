## 🌐 Offline Navigation Behavior

### ✅ What WORKS Offline:
- All sidebar links load pages ✅
- All dashboard cards navigate ✅
- Quick action buttons work ✅
- Page routing functions ✅
- Back/forward browser navigation ✅

### ⚠️ What Shows Empty Offline:
- Work Sites table (no API data)
- Employees table (no API data)
- Vehicles table (no API data)
- Daily Assignments table (no API data)
- Suppliers table (no API data)
- Stock table (no API data)
- Dashboard stats show 0
- Charts are empty
- Notifications show "Loading..." then empty

### 💡 User Experience Offline:
```
User clicks "Employees" in sidebar
  ↓
Page loads successfully ✅
  ↓
Page shows empty table ⚠️
  ↓
Message: "Limited functionalities" or "No data available"
```

**Navigation itself works perfectly - data fetching doesn't!**
